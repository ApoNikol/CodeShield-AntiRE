# CodeShield-AntiRE 🛡️ (Under Development)

A specialized security framework designed to help developers protect their software from **Reverse Engineering** attacks.

## 🚀 Vision
In the open-source and commercial world, protecting intellectual property and binary integrity is crucial. This tool aims to provide developers with a robust set of techniques to thwart unauthorized analysis and tampering.

## ✨ Planned Features
* **Code Obfuscation:** Layered techniques to make the code unreadable to decompilers.
* **Anti-Debugging:** Real-time detection of debuggers to prevent step-by-step analysis.
* **Binary Integrity Checks:** Ensuring the software hasn't been modified or "cracked."
* **Advanced Stripping:** Removing metadata and symbols that aid reverse engineers.

## 📅 Roadmap
This project is currently in the **active research and development phase**. I plan to release the first open-source beta version following my participation in **FOSDEM 2026**, where I hope to gain deeper insights from the Security & Reverse Engineering devrooms.
